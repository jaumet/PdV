Call List and scripts to call:
------------------------------

1) The python scripts and the data files are in C:\PdV\

2) The ditrectory structure is:
	C:\PdV\ -> python scripts (See description below)

	C:\PdV\data\ -> 
			map.tsv  -> the last map we are rewriting
			map.default-MadridCDN -> default (BackUp) map. Not used
			allContent.xml  -> (*) Map, you can choose where you want this file

	C:\PdV\data-tmp\
			key.tsv -> the file with the last votes. We rewrite this file for every votation
			allkey.tsv -> all the votations (key.tsv) appended. Usefull for votes analysis


	C:\PdV\data-tmp\log\ -> copies of all map.tsv with timestamp tag, i.e.: map-1327230982.tsv

3) Votation sequence:
	3.0 Read allContents.xml to get the question, time & questionID and represent it
	3.1) Click START votation
	3.2) Click STOP votation (from allContents.xml time)
	3.3) Call python script to EXPORT (mdb2stv.py)
	3.4) Click to clean the votation
	3.5) Call python script to get the RESULTS in map.tsv (votation_results.py) passing the questionID as argument.
	3.6) Read map.tsv from OF and represent it

4) Action -> python scripts call
	- EXPORT
		call -> mdb2tsv.py

	- FIRST VOTATION: where we put action = false (empty seats)
		call -> audience0.py

	- REST of votations, where we put in map.tsv: action = yes/no/abs in the not "false" and not "block" rows.
		call -> votation_results [questionID]
			(questionID is an integer number)
		TODO JAUME: get the questionID and add it to log map

	- PRESIDENT: we can choose n presidents. This scripts choose them randombly and adds action = block for each one
		call -> president.py [number]
			(for: president.py manual -> we need to find a way to add manually the chosen presidents!!)	
		TODO JAUME: rewrites the map blocking chosen ones

	- RECOLOCATION1: we pass from X true keypads to X/2. 
		call -> analyzer.py -m simple1 -o C:\PdV\data\map.tsv -c 3

		TODO JAUME: add active = block and rewrite map

	- RECOLOCATION2: we pass from Y keypads to 5 and we group them in 5 groups ( if is possible, otherwise < 5)
		call -> analyzer.py -m results -n 5 -o C:\PdV\data\map.tsv -c 3

		TODO JAUME: add active = block and reqrite map

	- ONE VOTER: 
		call -> 
		
q		TODO JAUME: all

	- BLOCK-CONDITIONS: Block keypads according to old votation results
		call -> 

		TODO JAUME: all
